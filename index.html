          a)

        <p>
        <p>b) <span>Can PPP overcome the deficient supply of pure public and merit goods?</span></p>
        <div class="ans">
          Ans :
          <b>Merit Goods</b> include goods which are provided by both government and private sectors. They are goods
          which
          depend on product consumption directly. People using those need to pay for it, and they get exhausted too
          often
          due to high consumption. They are available for personal consumption and to only a certain section of the
          society.
          For example, the construction of buildings of hospitals and schools, and their maintainance.
          <br>
          <b>Pure public goods</b> on the other hand are meant to be provided to one all regardless of who pays for it.
          They
          are made available by the government to the common public and are meant for mass consumption. Examples may be
          defence system, waste Management system, legal system, and street lighting.
          <br>
          <b>PPP or 3P</b> is responsible in incrementing the usage and availability of the pure public goods and merit
          goods. The taxpayers pay for their construction, and the private actors, businessmen, corporate industrialists
          invest in them, as a result the goods get available for all in no time, and the monetary expense for its
          availability gets dealt with smoothly. Also since expenses gets managed by the big firm, the scope of
          innovation
          and efficiency improves. The provision of incentives improves competition.

            1. It acts as a guide book of all departments involved in the budgeting process. <br>

            2. Less confusion will occur if answers to questions can be obtained from the manual. <br>

            3. It will be easier to resolve any difference between two departments when there are written instructions
            in
            the budget manual. <br>

            4. Reliance on memory is eliminated when a procedure is given in writing. <br>

            5. Clear instructions in budget manual will save time of the superiors as juniors will not ask for approval
            time
            and again. <br>

            6. It will reduce training time of the employees as oral instructions are supplemented with written
            procedures.

          d) <span>Limitations of Budgeting :</span> <br>
        <div class="ans">
          While budgeting performs many functions and has many advantages that are vital to an organization; it has
          certain limitations which require careful consideration. <br>

          <ol>
            1. Planning, budgeting, or forecasting is not an exact science; it uses approximations and judgement which
            may
            not be cent per cent accu­rate. At best, a budget is an estimate; no one knows precisely what will happen in
            the
            future. <br>

            2. The success and utility of budgeting depends on the cooperation and participation of all members of
            management. All persons should direct their efforts according to the plan. Moreover, the top management
            should
            adhere to the budget and provide cooperation. <br>

            3. A budget is only a tool, and it neither eliminates nor takes over the place of management. A budget
            cannot
            be substituted for manage­ment but should only be used by the management for accomplishing managerial
            functions.
            Executives generally feel ‘circled in’ by a budget and its related figures.

            They fail to understand that the budget is meant to provide detailed information, goals, and targets which
            may
            help them in achieving the company objectives. <br>

            4. It takes time to establish an efficient budgeting process. Also, some­times too much is expected from a
            budget and in case expectations are not fulfilled, the blame is put on the budget. An efficient budgeting
            programme requires that the responsible persons should understand the philosophy, objectives, and essentials
            of
            budgeting. <br>

            5. Excessive emphasis on budgeting may result in attempts by lower level of management and employees to buck
            the system by provid­ing inaccurate estimates of future costs and revenues. <br>
